		<h2>Your Weekly Schedule</h2>
		<p>Based on all the information you entered in the User Input Page, below is a schedule of your work and other commitments throughout the week. The empty spaces are slots where we thought you might have the spare time to dedicate to all your patient's needs (or else just take things easy for a while. You'll deserve a break after your hard work). If your schedule ever changes, you can always edit the Weekly Schedule database in the User Data page.</p>

		<p>The regular commute times are based on Google Maps API. Unfortunately, Google Maps doesn't know how much more slowly you need to drive your patient or what smooth alternate routes you need to take. Thus, the (specially marked slot)s include the patient-senstive commute time on the road if any time commitments require you to move the patient somewhere. That way you will not be confused or deceived by the extra time needed to travel.</p>
